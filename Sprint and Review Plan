#Review Plan
 	For every task, before putting into the "Done" list, lets discuss it in our team stand-ups.
 	For specific tasks like finalizing your documentations, will go through a review with me (Neha), Abigail and Gautam.
 	Use "Review: Stand-up" - for the tasks that can be marked done once discussed in our stand-ups.
 	Use "Review: Feedback" - for the tasks that can only be marked completed once a review is done from me (Neha), Abigail and Gautam.
