# DreamBig-Project

## Background / Context 

DreamBig aims to provide a personalised roadmap integrated with Ontrack to support students to develop and improve their employability after graduation. In addition, it will provide a platform to help set realistic expectations for students graduating into the real world.

DreamBig will be an integrated platform with Ontrack which helps contributing to student
employability. This is important to Thoth Tech as we believe in providing educational resources for
students.
